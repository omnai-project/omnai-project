# OmnAI-Project  

The **OmnAI Project** is an open-source initiative focused on a **generic, extensible way to acquire, display, and analyze time-series data**.  

---

## Origins  
OmnAI was born out of the [**aw4null project**](https://github.com/nabla-B/paper_aw4null-overview), a publicly funded multi-stage R&D effort.  
The project brought together **Auto-Intern GmbH** and **THGA Bochum**, exploring modern applications of:  

- USB oscilloscopes  
- Advanced signal analysis  
- Machine learning  

The goal: to **enhance diagnostics in automotive workshops** with open and reproducible tooling.

## Components of OmnAI  

- **OmnAI-DataServer**  
  A central hub that homogenizes multiple data sources. It provides flexible interfaces â€” **REST, WebSocket, gRPC**, and more â€” for accessing time-series data.  

- **OmnAI-View**  
  A visualization and management tool that consumes the DataServer API. It enables users to explore, organize, and interact with acquired data.  

- **OmnAI-Analysis**  
  Upcoming interfaces and pipelines for in-depth analysis, feature extraction, and machine learning on acquired signals.
